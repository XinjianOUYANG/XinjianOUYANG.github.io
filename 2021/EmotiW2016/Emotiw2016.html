        <b>EmotiW2016</b>: Video-Based Emotion Recognition using CNN-RNN and C3D Hybrid Networks
    </h1>

    <p>
        <b>Abstract</b>: The paper presents a "Video-Based Emotion Recognition using CNN-RNN and C3D Hybrid Networks", whose core modle is a hybrid network that combines recurrent neural network(RNN) and 3D convolutional networks(C3D) in a late-fusion fashion. The architecture of this network is shown as following:

        <b>limitations of traditional CNNs:</b>
        Traditional convolutional neural networks have a major limitation that they just handle spatial information. 
        For example, in the EmotiW2014 winner’s work, all video frames are extracted from videos and regarded as the static images for further process. 
        The aggregating image features of each video form a feature vector which neglects the important temporal video information.

        <b>Deep 3-dimensional convolutional networks (C3D):</b>
        C3D can model appearance and motion information simultaneously 
        and the C3D features with a linear classifier can achieve good performance 
        on different video analysis benchmarks. 
        It is found that C3D networks have a good performance in emotion recognition

        The main contribution of this paper: hybrid <b>CNN-RNN</b> + C3D

        <b>Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM):</b>
        As a particular type of recurrent neural networks, 
        the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is widely adopted. 
        LSTM has memory ability and suits for processing sequences with contexts well. 
        An encoder LSTM can be used to map an input sequence into a fixed length vector representation. 
        This vector representation is decoded using single decoder LSTM or multiple decoder LSTMs 
        to handle different tasks such as emotion classification. 
        Recently, LSTMs are also well developed and shown to be efficient to deal with various sequences versus sequences problems, 
        such as audio analysis, video captioning, video action recognition, and so on.
